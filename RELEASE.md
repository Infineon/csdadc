# Cypress CSDADC Middleware Library 2.0

### What's Included?

Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the [API Reference Guide](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/csdadc/csdadc_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) for a complete description of the CSDADC Middleware.
The revision history of the CSDADC Middleware is also available on the [API Reference Guide Changelog](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/csdadc/csdadc_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#group_csdadc_changelog).
New in this release:
* Updated CSDADC configuration structure to be aligned with the list of parameters in ModusToolbox CSD personality
* After conversion, the ADC channel is still connected to the CSD HW block, and disconnected only prior to new channel connection
* Added the CY_CSDADC_NO_CHANNEL macro
* Added the errata section

### Known Issues
| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| GPIO simultaneous operation with unrestricted strength and frequency creates noise that can affect CSDADC operation | Refer to the errata section of the device datasheet for details |

### Defect Fixes
* Fixing a compilation error for non CSDADC-capable devices: CSDADC MW sources are enclosed with the conditional compilation
* Added a cpuClk field to the CSDADC configuration structure
* Changed the Cy_CSDADC_StartConvert() and Cy_CSDADC_InterruptHandler() functions prototype
* Renamed function Cy_CSDADC_ConversionStatus() to Cy_CSDADC_GetConversionStatus()
